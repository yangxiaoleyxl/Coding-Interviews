## Hash Map
- Hash maps are indexed data structures. A hash map makes use of a hash function to compute an index with a key into an array of buckets or slots. Its value is mapped to the bucket with the corresponding index. The key is unique and immutable. Think of a hash map as a cabinet having drawers with labels for the things stored in them 

- Memory index access takes constant time and hashing takes constant time. Hence, the search complexity of a hash map is also constant time, that is, <font color="red"> O(1) </font>
